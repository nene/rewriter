Rewriter
========

A proof-of-concept JavaScript compiler that optimizes the speed of
array iteration.

Built on top of [hammerjs][].

To run:

    $ hammerjs rewriter.js your-script.js

In spe outputs the optimized version of `your-script.js`.  More likely
crashes or simply screws up your JavaScript.
